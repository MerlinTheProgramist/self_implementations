ST doesn’t put a strong condition on its structure to be always balanced. 
Instead, it uses heuristics to move the last accessed element to the root of the tree in the hope that it has a higher probability of being accessed later. 
Thus, the last accessed elements get placed near the root of the tree.
The essential basis of ST is the splaying operation. 
It’s used to move the last accessed element to the root.
